INTRODUCTION
==================
CAVITY is a structure-based protein binding site detection program. Identifying the 
location of ligand binding sites on a protein is of fundamental importance for a 
range of applications including molecular docking, de novo drug design, structural 
identification and comparison of functional sites. It uses the purely geometrical 
method to find potential ligand binding site, then uses geometrical structure and 
physical chemistry property information to locate ligand binding sites. CAVITY will 
provide a maximal ligand binding affinity prediction for the binding site. The most 
important, CAVITY could define accurate and clear binding site for drug design.


SOFTWARE FILES
==================
This software can be used on LINUX platform. It is not an open sourced software and 
user just need to uncompress the software cavity.tar.gz to run the executable
binary files under the cavity directory. The default executable file was compiled
under 32-bit system(cavity32), 64-bit system(cavity64), respectively. User may use
the corresponding file according to your system.

Uncompress:
        tar -zxf cavity.tar.gz

The software contains the following directories and files:
 example/		example file directory
 default/		default presets
 parameter/		necessary parameter
 cavity32		32-bit program
 cavity64		64-bit program
 cavity.input		default input file templat template
 COPYING		license
 README		this file


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
==================
Add the following line into ~/.bashrc or ~/.cshrc or ~/.tcshrc (According to your shell)

ulimit -s unlimited

NOTICE: This would NOT take effect in shells opened so far.
Please relogin current shell before running CAVITY



BRIEF TUTORIAL
==================
1> Get the target protein structure. 
Example: download 1DB4 to "example/AA/1db4.pdb"

2> Prepare the input file for CAVITY.
Example: Editing the "example/cavity-AA.input"
---------------------------------------------------------------
   RECEPTOR_FILE	example/AA/1db4.pdb
---------------------------------------------------------------

3> Run CAVITY
Example: run under directory "cavity"
---------------------------------------------------------------
   ./cavityXX example/cavity-AA.input	(XX is 32 or 64)
---------------------------------------------------------------

4> View the results and estimate the drugability
Example: View the output surface "example/AA/1db4_surface_1.pdb"
---------------------------------------------------------------
   REMARK   5 Predicted Maximal pKd: XX.XXX
   REMARK   5 Predicted Average pKd: XX.XXX
   REMARK   6 DrugScore : XX.XXX
   REMARK   6 Druggability: XXX
---------------------------------------------------------------
Then open "example/AA/1db4_surface_1.pdb" by Pymol

5> Run CAVITY for RNA and DNA detection
Example: run under directory "cavity"
---------------------------------------------------------------
   ./cavityXX example/cavity-RNA.input	(XX is 32 or 64)
---------------------------------------------------------------
   ./cavityXX example/cavity-DNA.input	(XX is 32 or 64)
---------------------------------------------------------------
View the results files in the same way


PARAMETER SETS
==================

   For convenience, we provide some default parameter sets to adapt different task, 
user may simply loaded them into your parameter file by the keyword "INCLUDE" . 
They are under the path "cavity/default/", including 5 default sets:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Overall default set:
   default.input: The overall default parameter set of CAVITY. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Detection mode set: 
   standard.input: For common binding-site,default.
   peptide.input: For shallow cavity, e.g.peptide-protein, protein-protein interface.
   large.input: For large and complex cavity, e.g. large protein-protein interface, 
multi-function cavity, multi-substrate cavity, channel, nucleic acid site 
   super.input: For super-sized cavity, e.g. large channel, large polymer interface.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Ligand-locate mode set: 
   locate.input: This parameter will lead to ligand locate mode, and CAVITY will 
ignore monomers that are far from the ligand or prohibited by user. (Rely on LIGAND_FILE)
---------------------------------------------------------------




BASIC PARAMETER
==================

    DETECT_MODE: Detect mode of CAVITY. 0: Whole protein mode, CAVITY will detect 
the whole protein to find potential binding sites, and this is the default mode. 
1: Ligand mode, CAVITY will detect around the given Mol2 file. It helps the program 
do know where the real binding site locates. In most cases, CAVITY could locate 
the binding site without given ligand coordinates, and you may try this mode if 
you are dissatisfied with the result from whole protein mode. 2: Area mode, CAVITY 
will detect the specific space area assigned by user. User may constrain the binding 
site by this mode to rule out undesired subsite.

    RECEPTOR_FILE: The PDB file presenting the target protein. This file is absolutely 
necessary to run CAVITY. 

    LIGAND_FILE: The Mol2 file presenting a ligand of the target protein (Needed if 
DETECT_MODE is 1). It guide CAVITY to define detection boundary, therefore it will 
be ideal if the size, shape, and location of the ligand is proper. A ligand 
extracted directly from the complex structure will be just fine.



ADVANCED PARAMETER
=================
---------------------------------------------------------------
Input Section:
    PARAMETER_DIRECTORY: The path of the directory "parameter". Under this directory,
there are force field parameters used by Cavity.
    MIN/MAX_X/Y/Z: The vertices coordinates of a box constrained the detection space 
area( Needed if DETECT_MODE is 2)
    HETMETAL: YES: Metal irons in the protein will be considered, NO: Contrary to 
YES. Default: YES
    HETWATER: YES: Water in the protein will be considered, NO: Contrary to YES. 
Default: No
---------------------------------------------------------------
Output Section:
    OUTPUT_RANK: CavityScore limit. CAVITY will only output detected binding-sites 
whose CavityScore are greater than the value. User may increase this value to 
prevent CAVITY outputting useless results.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter Section:
    JUDGE: Detection Method: 0:Surface mode. Detect cavity boundary by geometrical 
shape of the surface. This mode has some superiority in protein-protein interface 
detection. 1:Vacant mode. Detect cavity boundary by geometrical shape of volume. 
This mode has some superiority in large binding-site detection. 2:Detect cavity 
boundary by geometrical shape of the cavity surface and volume. This mode has some 
superiority in compact binding-site detection and binding site split. For drug 
design, the 3rd method always gives the best detection results. For cavity 
detection only, the 2nd method would be much more robust in detecting various proteins.
Default: 2.
    RADIUS_LENTH: The radius of eraser ball (unit: 0.5 ang.). User may increase 
this radius to detect plane and shallow binding-site, e.g. peptides binding site,
protein-protein interface.Default: 10
    SEPARATE_MIN_DEPTH: Default minimal depth of binding-site. Linkage between 
sub-cavity that do not reach this critical will be cut.
    SEPARATE_MAX_LIMIT: Default surface area. Increase this value if the real 
binding site is much larger than the detection result, and vice-versa. (valid when JUDGE is 0)
    MAX_ABSTRACT_LIMIT: Default abstract surface area. Increase this value if 
the real binding site is much larger than the detection result, and vice-versa. 
(valid when JUDGE is 0)
    MAX_ABSTRACT_DEPTH: Default abstract depth. Increase this value if the real 
binding site is much larger than the detection result, and vice-versa. (valid 
when JUDGE is 1 or 2)
    MAX_DEPTH_VACANT: Default depth estimation parameter. (valid when JUDGE is 1 or 2)
    MAX_ABSTRACT_LIMIT_V: Default abstract volume. Increase this value if the 
real binding site is much larger than the detection result, and vice-versa. 
(valid when JUDGE is 2)
    SEPARATE_MAX_LIMIT_V: Default volume. Increase this value if the real 
binding site is much larger than the detection result, and vice-versa. 
(valid when JUDGE is 2)   
---------------------------------------------------------------




RESULT ANALYSIS
==================

The output filenames will be prefixed with the name of the RECEPTOR_FILE 
and the binding-site number.

CAVITY will output the following visual files for viewing the detection result.
---------------------------------------------------------------
    name_surface.pdb:  The output file storing the surface shape of the 
binding-site and the CavityScore. It is in PDB format, and user can use 
molecular modeling software to view this file and obtain an insight into 
the geometrical shape of the binding site. User can view this file by 
plain text editor, and check the predicted maximal pKd of the binding 
site. This value indicated the ligandability of the binding site. If 
it is less than 6.0(Kd is 1uM), suggests that this binding-site may be 
not a suitable drug design target.
    name_vacant.pdb: The output file storing the volume shape of the 
binding-site. It is in PDB format, and user can use molecular modeling 
software to view this file and obtain an insight into the geometrical 
shape of the binding site.
    name_cavity.pdb: The output file storing the atoms forming the 
binding-site. It is in PDB format, and user can use molecular modeling 
software to view this file and obtain an insight into the residues of 
the binding site. It is the visual version of "name_pocket.txt".
---------------------------------------------------------------
Notice: Some molecular modeling software may not display these files 
correctly, please try different software if you could not view the 
results file. (Pymol is recommended to support these output files.)
---------------------------------------------------------------

CAVITY will derive the key interaction sites inside the binding site 
and, based on that, suggest a pharmacophore model. The following 
files are concerned with this:
---------------------------------------------------------------
    name_key_site.pdb: The output file storing the key interaction 
sites derived inside the binding site. It is in PDB format, in which 
nitrogen atoms (blue) represent hydrogen-bond donor sites; oxygen atoms 
(red) represent hydrogen-bond acceptor sites; and carbon atoms (green) 
represent hydrophobic sites. Users can use any molecular modeling 
software to view this file and obtain an insight into the 
characteristics of the binding site.
    name_pharmacophore.pdb: The output file storing the derived 
pharmacophore model. It is in PDB format. The definition of key 
features is the same as the one in "name_key_site.pdb".
   name_pharmacophore.txt: The output file storing the information 
of the derived pharmacophore model. It lists the pharmacophore features 
and the internal distances between them. It also ranks all the features 
according to their binding scores. Actually, it is the text version 
of "name_pharmacophore.pdb".
